## Description

Dubrah is an iOS mobile application designed to connect individuals who offer services with those who need them. The platform enables users to discover, book, and exchange services such as tutoring, home repairs, graphic design, consulting, and more — all within a single, user-friendly application.

The app simplifies service discovery while prioritizing trust, transparency, and accessibility. Service seekers can browse verified providers, review portfolios and ratings, communicate directly through in-app messaging, and manage bookings seamlessly. Service providers can showcase their skills, manage orders, and grow their local client base.

Dubrah bridges the gap between capable service providers and individuals who struggle to find credible local services. By building a secure digital ecosystem for skill and service exchange, Dubrah supports community-driven economic growth and aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:
- SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth
- SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities
